				I was born in a small town in Bashkiria and studied at an ordinary gymnasium until the 6th
				grade. After that, I passed the selection and began studying at the engineering gender
				boarding school for gifted children.
			</p>
			<p>
				I participated in Olympiads and training camps. Thanks to this, I was noticed and invited to
				study at the Engineering Lyceum in Kazan, where I continued to engage in Olympiad and
				project activities in mathematics, linguistics and chemistry.

				After graduating from school with a gold medal and high exam scores, I was able to enter the
				university of my dreams, and now I am studying in the city of <a
